## Communicating

I strongly favor [SourceHut](https://sr.ht)'s workflows, so I'll probably set up
a mailing list for discussions and patches. You can reach me
[there](https://sr.ht/~renerocksai) via
[e-mail](~renerocksai/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht).

A whole discord server as another option, while a funny idea, seems like a bit
of an overkill. You can reach me on [the zig showtime discord
server](https://discord.gg/CBzE3VMb) under the handle renerocksai
(renerocksai#1894).

Pull-requests and issues are, of course, welcome, too - and may be, for the time
being, the most both sane and GitHub-friendly way of communicating.
